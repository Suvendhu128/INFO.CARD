# INFO.CARD

The code is an HTML document that defines a user information card. The document has the following elements:

A <head> element that contains the document's metadata, such as the title and the character encoding.
A <body> element that contains the document's content.
A <div class="container"> element that is the container for the user information card.
A <div id="info-card"> element that is the user information card itself.
A h1 element that contains the title of the card.
A div id="user-info"> element that contains the user information.
A series of <div class="field"> elements that each contain a label and a piece of user information.
A <script src="script.js"></script> element that references a JavaScript file that will be used to dynamically populate the user information.
The user information card is a simple but effective way to display a user's information. The card is divided into a series of fields, each of which contains a label and a piece of information. The labels are used to identify the information, and the information can be any type of data, such as text, numbers, or dates.

The JavaScript file can be used to dynamically populate the user information. This means that the information can be changed without having to edit the HTML document. This is useful for applications that need to display the user's information in real time, such as a chat application or a social media app.


# JAVASCRIPT

The code is a JavaScript function that stores and retrieves user information from localStorage. The function has the following steps:

It gets the user information from localStorage.
If the user information exists, it parses it as a JSON object.
It then sets the text content of the first-name, last-name, country, phone-number, state, city, and village elements to the corresponding values in the user information object.
If the user information does not exist, it prompts the user to enter their information.
It then stores the user information in localStorage and sets the text content of the first-name, last-name, country, phone-number, state, city, and village elements to the corresponding values in the user information object.
The code uses the following JavaScript functions:

localStorage.getItem(): Gets the value of a key from localStorage.
JSON.parse(): Parses a stringified JSON object into a JavaScript object.
document.getElementById(): Gets the element with the specified ID.
textContent: Sets the text content of an element.
prompt(): Prompts the user for input.
